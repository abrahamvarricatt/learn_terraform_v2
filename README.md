I'm going to use this repository to try and follow along with the tutorial here,

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/hashicorp-terraform-associate-certification-study-course-pass-the-exam-with-this-free-12-hour-course/

Here is a link to the youtube video,

And here is the official github repo,

I've cloned the above locally, but feel it better for learning purposes to just write up my own. 

Also, there are a few things I want to do differently - like installing git pre-commit and running
terraform fmt & validate.
